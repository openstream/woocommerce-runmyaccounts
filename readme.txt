No. Run my Accounts for WooCommerce requires WooCommerce to provide all features.

= Do I need a paid account with Run my Accounts? =

Yes. Without the paid account you are not able to set up your company within Run my Accounts.

= Is the plugin for free? =

The source code is freely available, but you need a Run my Accounts API key. Openstream and Run my Accounts agreed that plugin users will be charged CHF 200.- yearly for plugin maintenance, i.e. for making sure that the plugin works with new versions of WordPress and WooCommerce.
